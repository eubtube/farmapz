#Framework 

#Use intersect to determine true postive area of each polygon

#USe Differencing for to determine error outside of truth polygon (false Postive)

#area that is within the truth polygon that does not intersect with the mechanical turks polygon
#compare intersected area with area of truth (false negative)

#somehow eliminate all mechanical Turks polygons that do not have centroid or significantly intersect with truth polygon
